## About Me

I am currently an EngD student at Sun Yat-sen University, supervised by [Prof. Liang Lin](http://www.linliang.net/) and [Prof. Pengxu Wei](https://pengxuwei.github.io/).  I am a member of [HCP Lab](https://www.sysu-hcp.net/) (Human-Cyber-Physical Intelligence Integration Lab) leaded by Prof. Liang Lin.  Before that, I received the MEng and BEng in Computer Science and Technology at Sun Yat-sen University in 2023 and 2020, respectively, advised by Prof. Liang Lin, Prof. Cong Liu, and Prof. Pengxu Wei.

## Research Interests

My general research interest is to build trustworthy deep learning systems for computer vision and beyond. Specifically, I am focusing on:

- **Machine Learning:** adversarial robustness, domain adaptation, causality in deep learning
- **AI Generated Content (AIGC):** controllable image/video generation, detection/evaluation of AIGC

## News

- **[Mar. 2023]** One paper on adversarially robust source-free domain adaptation is accepted to ICME 2023.
- **[Mar. 2023]** One paper on large model fine-tuning and causality is accepted to CVPR 2023.
