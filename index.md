## About Me

I am an EngD student at Sun Yat-sen University, supervised by [Prof. Liang Lin](http://www.linliang.net/). I am a member of [HCP Lab](https://www.sysu-hcp.net/) (Human-Cyber-Physical Intelligence Integration Lab) leaded by Prof. Liang Lin, and currently a visiting student in [LV-Lab](https://www.lv-lab.org/nus/index.html), National University of Singapore, under the supervision of [Prof. Shuicheng Yan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/yansc/). Before that, I received the MEng and BEng in Computer Science and Technology at Sun Yat-sen University in 2023 and 2020, respectively, advised by Prof. Liang Lin, Prof. Cong Liu, and [Prof. Pengxu Wei](https://pengxuwei.github.io/).

## Research Interests

My general research interest is to build trustworthy and evolving deep learning systems for computer vision and beyond, including:

- **AI Generated Content (AIGC):** detection/evaluation of AIGC, controllable and efficient image/video generation
- **Machine Learning:** adversarial robustness, domain adaptation, causality in deep learning

## News

- **[May 2025]** One paper on AI-generated image detection accepted to ICML 2025.
- **[Jan. 2025]** One paper on adversarial robustness accepted to ICLR 2025.
- **[July 2024]** One paper on controllable image generation accepted to ACMMM 2024.
- **[Mar. 2023]** One paper on adversarially robust source-free domain adaptation is accepted to ICME 2023 (oral).
- **[Mar. 2023]** One paper on large model fine-tuning and causality is accepted to CVPR 2023.
